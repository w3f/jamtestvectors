# Work Reports STF Test Vectors

## Schema

Both the binary and json formats adhere to the overarching JAM protocol ASN.1
[schema](../jam-types-asn/jam-types.asn), as well as the specific vectors
[schema](./reports.asn) defined for these test cases.

## Authorization Pools Management

This subsystem is **not responsible** for modifying the contents of the
authorization pools, which are read-only within the scope of this STF.

Any update to the pools is delegated to the dedicated ["authorizations"](../authorizations/README.md)
subsystem, which is tasked with removing consumed items from the authorization
pools and introduce new authorizers from the authorization queue.

## Statistics

A subset of service ($π_S$) and core ($π_S$) activity statistics updated by the
STF subsystem used to process these test vectors.

In particular, for cores statistics we may update imports (i), exports (e),
extrinsic_size (z), extrinsic_count (x), bundle_size (b), gas_used (u).
For services statistics we may update refinement_count (r.0), refinement_gas_used (r.1),
imports (i), exports (x), extrinsic_size (z), extrinsic_count (x).

## Tiny Vectors

- [report_curr_rotation](./tiny/report_curr_rotation-1.json) 🟢
  - Report uses current guarantors rotation.
- [report_prev_rotation](./tiny/report_prev_rotation-1.json) 🟢
  - Report uses previous guarantors rotation.
  - Previous rotation falls within previous epoch, thus previous epoch validators
    set is used to construct report core assignment to pick expected guarantors.

  - Work report per core gas is too much high.
- [service_item_gas_too_low](./tiny/service_item_gas_too_low.json) 🔴
  - Accumulate gas is below the service minimum.

- [no_enough_guarantees](./tiny/no_enough_guarantees-1.json) 🔴
  - Report with no enough guarantors signatures.
- [not_authorized](./tiny/not_authorized-1.json) 🔴
  - Target core without any authorizer.
- [not_authorized](./tiny/not_authorized-2.json) 🔴
  - Target core with unexpected authorizer.
- [not_sorted_guarantor](./tiny/not_sorted_guarantor-1.json) 🔴
  - Guarantors indices are not sorted or unique.
- [out_of_order_guarantees](./tiny/out_of_order_guarantees-1.json) 🔴
